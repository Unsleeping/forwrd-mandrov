- Support delete user functionality - onClick on the trash icon on the right side of each row

we have a Save btn, after i delete a raw, i should immediately delete this user from global state, or only after i do delete and press save btn my deleted user should be removed from global state?

- Support add a new user functionality - onClick on the plus button on the top
  a click on the plus button should render a new row above the existing rows (newly added row would be first),
  it's field values would be empty (a placeholder of the input name should be shown inside each input when empty)

if i render select options as constant array, so there is not empty value for country select. is it correct behavior or no?
