1. - Successful save => updates the shared global state (as mentioned before) and local error states should be reset

do i really need to care about it? i thought that until there are errors i cant hit save btn
i mean there is a quote from task:
"Save button should be disabled if there is at least one error, or if there is at least one empty field (on blur on a new row - empty fields are marked as error)"
