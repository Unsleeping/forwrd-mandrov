# Forwrd List

An optimized Vite + TypeScript + React project designed for high performance with complex forms and long lists.

## Features

- **React Hook Form (RHF)**: Utilizes React Hook Form to minimize re-renders and efficiently manage form state, enhancing the performance and responsiveness of complex forms.
- **Shadcn UI**: Integrated Shadcn UI for a beautiful, accessible design system, saving development time on styling and providing a consistent, polished UI without custom CSS.
- **Virtualized Lists**: Implements row virtualization, rendering only visible items in long lists to drastically improve performance and reduce memory usage.
- **Uncontrolled Inputs**: Uses uncontrolled inputs to prevent unnecessary re-renders during form interactions, making it ideal for large lists with minimal lag.
